## About

Calcom Web is the next leap towards making computation even better with Calcom. As can be guessed from the name, Calcom Web is the web version of Calcom, which is a fast and efficient computational tool designed from students and educators and packed with a lot of features that indeed make computation simplified!


### Using the Web version of Calcom

The Log in button will redirect the user to Gitpod where Calcom Web is present. Once the window opens a **Browser window** will open (for displaying GUIs) and the user wil be prompted about the fact that there is a service open on port 5090. Users may ignore this message. For best experience open the earlier mentioned **browser window** on a separate tab using the Redirect button at the top right corner or copy pasting the link to a separate tab. The next step is to move to the terminal window and type the following command:

```./run.sh```

After all the required configurations are done, Calcom Web will automatically start. All the GUIs will be displayed in the browser window so be sure to view that as well while using Calcom.
